### Required Software

As described in the Methods section (2) of the paper, we use a combination of open source software. In order to recreate our results and conduct analysis, the following open source softward was used:

- [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) (2016.3)
- [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) (2.4)
- [python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6)

### Guide

- __Step 1__ - Use our methods section to generate 

- __Step 2__ - Follow our methods section in order to equilibrate and run sets of molecular dynamics trajectories for each toxin.

- __Step 3__ - 

- __Step 4__ - 

- __Step 5__ -  

  - __Step 5.1__ -
